The vulnerability exists in the BIG-IP Edge Client Windows Installer. The installer is vulnerable to DLL hijacking, which means an attacker could trick the installer into loading a malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need to place a malicious DLL in a directory searched by the installer.

To create a PoC for this vulnerability, follow these steps:

1. Create a malicious DLL with the same name as the DLL that the installer is looking for. For example, if the installer is looking for "foo.dll", name your malicious DLL "foo.dll".
2. Place the malicious DLL in a directory that is searched by the installer. The installer searches for DLLs in the same directory as the installer executable, as well as in any directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
3. Run the installer.
4. When the installer attempts to load the DLL, it will load the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
