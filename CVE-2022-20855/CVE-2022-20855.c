// CVE-2022-20855 is a vulnerability that allows a local user to gain elevated privileges on the affected system. 
// This vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the way a certain component of the operating system handles file permissions.
// This code opens the /etc/passwd file and sets its permissions to include the setuid bit, which allows any user who executes the file to gain elevated privileges. 
// An attacker could use this vulnerability to create a malicious program that, when executed by a local user with limited privileges, gains elevated privileges and carries out malicious actions, such as modifying system files, installing malware, or stealing sensitive data.
