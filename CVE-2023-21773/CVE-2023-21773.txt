# Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2023-21773) PoC

This is a proof of concept (PoC) for the Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2023-21773).

## Vulnerability Description

The vulnerability allows a local attacker to elevate privileges on a vulnerable system. The vulnerability exists due to an incorrect implementation of the kernel access control list (ACL) check. A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application and gaining elevated privileges.

## PoC Description

The PoC demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability to elevate privileges on a vulnerable system. The PoC uses the `NtSetInformationProcess` function to modify the access token of the current process, granting the process SeDebugPrivilege. The PoC then spawns a new process with the elevated privileges using the `CreateProcessWithTokenW` function.

## Usage

Compile the PoC using Visual Studio or GCC. Run the resulting executable with administrator privileges. The PoC will spawn a new elevated process with the specified command-line arguments.
