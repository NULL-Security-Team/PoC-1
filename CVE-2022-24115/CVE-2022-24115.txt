CVE-2022-24115 is a vulnerability related to authentication bypass in D-Link VPN routers. 
An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism of the device and gain unauthorized access to the router's administrative console.

Here's a possible proof of concept:

1. Identify the target D-Link VPN router's IP address.

2. Using a web browser, visit the administrative console of the router by accessing: "http://<router-IP-address>".

3. Observe that the login page is displayed, prompting the user to enter a username and password.

4. Using a proxy tool such as Burp Suite or ZAP, intercept and modify the HTTP POST request sent from the login form to the server.

5. Change the value of the "Authorization" header to an arbitrary value, for example: "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=". This header value decodes to "admin:admin", 
which is the default username and password for many D-Link routers.

6. Forward the modified request to the server.

7. Observe that the server accepts the request and grants access to the administrative console, bypassing the authentication mechanism.

8. Verify that the attacker now has full access to the router's configuration settings and can modify them as desired.
